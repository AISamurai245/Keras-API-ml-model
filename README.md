# Train a Machine Learning Model using Prebuilt Dataset with Keras

This README guide will walk you through the process of training a machine learning model using a prebuilt dataset and the Keras API. In this example, we will use the popular MNIST dataset to build a neural network that classifies images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can check the TensorFlow version by running the following code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
```
